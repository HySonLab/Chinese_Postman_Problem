### Graph Library (```graph_library/```)

* Implementation for the graph data structure and basic algorithms: ```Graph.h```.
* **Meta-heuristics (e.g., greedy, ILS, VNS)** implementation: ```meta_heuristics.h```. With multi-threading (much faster): ```meta_heuristics_multithreads.h```.
* **Evolutionary Algorithm (EA)** implementation: ```evolutionary_algorithm.h```. With multi-threading (much faster): ```evolutionary_algorithm_multithreads.h```.
* **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** implementation: ```ant_colony_optimization.h```. With multi-threading (much faster): ```ant_colony_optimization_multithreads.h```.
* **Brute-Force / Back-Tracking** implementation: ```brute_force.h```. With multi-threading (much faster): ```brute_force_multithreads.h```.
